Learning Rust
=============

Welcome to my Rust learning journey! This README documents my progress, resources, and projects as I explore the Rust programming language.

Why Rust?
---------

Rust is a systems programming language that offers:

-   Low level programming language
-   Compiled code can run natively everywhere.
-   Memory safety without garbage collection
-   Concurrency without data races
-   Abstraction without overhead
-   Stability without stagnation

Key Rust Concepts
-----------------

As I learn Rust, here are some key concepts I'm focusing on:

1.  **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust's unique approach to memory management
    -   Each value has an "owner" variable
    -   Only one owner at a time
    -   When owner goes out of scope, value is dropped
    -   Borrowing allows references to values without taking ownership
2.  **Lifetimes**: A way to express the scope for which references are valid
    -   Helps prevent dangling references
    -   Often implicit, but sometimes need to be explicitly annotated
3.  **Traits**: Defining shared behavior across types
    -   Similar to interfaces in other languages
    -   Can be implemented for any type, including built-in types
4.  **Pattern Matching**: A powerful feature for destructuring and matching complex data
    -   Used with `match` expressions and `if let` constructs
5.  **Error Handling**: Using `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` types
    -   `Result` for operations that can fail
    -   `Option` for values that may or may not exist
6.  **Generics**: Writing code that works with multiple types
    -   Enables code reuse without runtime cost
7.  **Macros**: Code that writes code
    -   Declarative macros with `macro_rules!`
    -   Procedural macros for more complex scenarios
8.  **Unsafe Rust**: For operations that the compiler can't guarantee are safe
    -   Allows things like raw pointer manipulation
    -   Should be used sparingly and carefully

Rust's Type System
------------------

Rust has a rich type system including:

-   Primitive types: integers, floats, booleans, characters
-   Compound types: tuples, arrays
-   String types: `String` and `str`
-   Custom types: structs, enums
-   Function types
-   Pointer types: references, raw pointers, function pointers
-   Trait objects

Rust's Standard Library
-----------------------

Key components of Rust's standard library:

-   Collections: Vec, HashMap, VecDeque, BTreeMap, etc.
-   Smart pointers: Box, Rc, Arc
-   Concurrency primitives: Thread, Mutex, Arc
-   I/O operations: File, Read, Write traits
-   Networking: TcpListener, TcpStream

Rust Toolchain
--------------

Essential tools in the Rust ecosystem:

-   `rustc`: The Rust compiler
-   `cargo`: Rust's package manager and build system
-   `rustup`: Toolchain installer and version manager
-   `rustfmt`: Code formatter
-   `clippy`: Linter for catching common mistakes

Learning Resources
------------------

Here are resources I'm using to learn Rust:

1.  [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
2.  [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
3.  [Exercism Rust Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)
4.  [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
5.  [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) (for advanced unsafe Rust)

Project Ideas
-------------

As I progress, I plan to work on:

-   [ ]  CLI tool (e.g., a file organizer or text processor)
-   [ ]  Web server using Actix-web or Rocket
-   [ ]  Concurrent web scraper
-   [ ]  Simple database implementation
-   [ ]  Rust plugin for another system
-   [ ]  WebAssembly module
-   [ ]  Systems programming project (e.g., a simple OS kernel)

Progress Log
------------

### Week 1

-   Installed Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo, rustup)
-   Completed chapters 1-3 of "The Rust Programming Language" book
-   Learned about variables, mutability, and basic types

### Week 2

-   

### Week 3

-   (To be updated)

Goals
-----

-   [ ]  Finish "The Rust Programming Language" book 
-   [ ]  Complete all Rust exercises on Exercism 
-   [ ]  Build a substantial project in Rust (web server or database)
-   [ ]  Contribute to a Rust open-source project
-   [ ]  Dive into unsafe Rust and advanced topics

Notes
-----

I'll update this README regularly with my progress, challenges faced, and insights gained while learning Rust. Particular areas of interest include:

-   Mastering borrow checker concepts
-   Effective use of traits and generics
-   Writing idiomatic Rust code
-   Understanding performance implications of different Rust constructs
-   Best practices for error handling and robust program design in Rust

Future of Rust
----

- Continued growth in systems programming
- Increased adoption in web development (backend and WebAssembly)
- Expansion in embedded systems and IoT
- Potential growth in mobile development
- Ongoing language improvements (e.g., const generics, async traits)
